# Buddy-the-discord-chatbot
not sure what to put here rn, but the bot can perform the following functions :
- Respond to texts (static responses for now)
- Calculate
- Play simple games (3 for now)
- Perform a wiki search (imported library)
- Tell programming jokes (that I don't understand yet)

And well, that's all, will put update logs here whenever changes are made
